user_description: "Разбирает конкурентов и собирает батлкарту — один HTML-файл с матрицей сравнения, вкладкой на каждого соперника, репликами продавца и вопросами, которые вскрывают их слабые места. Нужен, когда в сделке всплывает «а чем вы лучше», и ответ должен быть готов заранее, а не сочиняться на ходу."

## Когда применять

Sales-батлкарта конкурентов: интерактивный HTML с матрицей сравнения. Триггеры: «battlecard», «чем мы лучше конкурента». НЕ маркетинг → competitive-analysis-mktg.

# Competitive Intelligence

Research your competitors extensively and generate an **interactive HTML battlecard** you can use in deals. The output is a self-contained artifact with clickable competitor tabs and an overall comparison matrix.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ALWAYS (works standalone via web search)                        │
│  ✓ Competitor product deep-dive: features, pricing, positioning │
│  ✓ Recent releases: what they've shipped in last 90 days        │
│  ✓ Your company releases: what you've shipped to counter        │
│  ✓ Differentiation matrix: where you win vs. where they win     │
│  ✓ Sales talk tracks: how to position against each competitor   │
│  ✓ Landmine questions: expose their weaknesses naturally        │

## Getting Started

**Read `~/.hermes/ccpack/business-context.md` first** — sections "Product" (what you sell, how you differ, and honestly what rivals do better), "Positioning" (who you're compared against), and "Pricing". No such file? Create it from `~/.hermes/ccpack/templates/business-context.md` — it's the pack-wide context file, in Russian, and this skill reads the same one.

Without it a battlecard is a list of competitor facts with no "us" column: your reps get a comparison table that never says why we win, and the "what they do better" row — the one that actually survives a live objection — will be blank.

Then confirm or fill in what the file doesn't cover:

**Required:**
- Your main competitors (1-5 names) — take them from "Positioning" if they're listed there.

**Optional:**
- Which competitor to focus on first?
- Specific deals where you're competing against them?
- Pain points you've heard from customers about competitors?

Answers that hold across sessions belong in `business-context.md`, not in this chat — otherwise you retype them every time.

---

## Connectors (Optional)

| Connector | What It Adds |
|-----------|--------------|
| **CRM** | Win/loss history against each competitor, deal-level competitor tracking |
| **Docs** | Existing battlecards, product comparison docs, competitive playbooks |
| **Chat** | Internal chat intel (e.g. Slack) — what your team is hearing from the field |
| **Transcripts** | Competitor mentions in customer calls, objections raised |

> **No connectors?** Web research works great. I'll pull everything from public sources — product pages, pricing, blogs, release notes, reviews, job postings.

---

## Output: Interactive HTML Battlecard

The skill generates a **self-contained HTML file** with:

### 1. Comparison Matrix (Landing View)
Overview comparing you vs. all competitors at a glance:
- Feature comparison grid
- Pricing comparison
- Market positioning
- Win rate indicators (if CRM connected)

### 2. Competitor Tabs (Click to Expand)
Each competitor gets a clickable card that expands to show:
- Company profile (size, funding, target market)
- What they sell and how they position
- Recent releases (last 90 days)
- Where they win vs. where you win
- Pricing intelligence
- Talk tracks for different scenarios
- Objection handling
- Landmine questions

### 3. Your Company Card
- Your releases (last 90 days)
- Your key differentiators
- Proof points and customer quotes

## Visual Design

### Color System
```css
:root {
    /* Dark theme base */
    --bg-primary: #0a0d14;
    --bg-elevated: #0f131c;
    --bg-surface: #161b28;
    --bg-hover: #1e2536;

    /* Text */
    --text-primary: #ffffff;

    --text-muted: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);

    /* Accent (your brand or neutral) */
    --accent: #3b82f6;
    --accent-hover: #2563eb;

    /* Status indicators */
    --you-win: #12b886;
    --they-win: #ef4444;
    --tie: #f59e0b;
}
```

### Card Design
- Rounded corners (12px)
- Subtle borders (1px, low opacity)
- Hover states with slight elevation
- Smooth transitions (200ms)

### Comparison Matrix
- Sticky header row
- Color-coded winner indicators (green = you, red = them, yellow = tie)
- Expandable rows for detail

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Gather Seller Context

```
If first time:
1. Ask: "What company do you work for?"
2. Ask: "What do you sell? (product/service in one line)"
3. Ask: "Who are your main competitors? (up to 5)"
4. Store context for future sessions

If returning user:
1. Confirm: "Still at [Company] selling [Product]?"
2. Ask: "Same competitors, or any new ones to add?"
```

### Phase 2: Research Your Company (Always)

```
Web searches:
1. "[Your company] product" — current offerings
2. "[Your company] pricing" — pricing model
3. "[Your company] news" — recent announcements (90 days)
4. "[Your company] product updates OR changelog OR releases" — what you've shipped
5. "[Your company] vs [competitor]" — existing comparisons
```

### Phase 3: Research Each Competitor (Always)

```
For each competitor, run:
1. "[Competitor] product features" — what they offer
2. "[Competitor] pricing" — how they charge
3. "[Competitor] news" — recent announcements
4. "[Competitor] product updates OR changelog OR releases" — what they've shipped
5. "[Competitor] reviews G2 OR Capterra OR TrustRadius" — customer sentiment
6. "[Competitor] vs [alternatives]" — how they position
7. "[Competitor] customers" — who uses them
8. "[Competitor] careers" — hiring signals (growth areas)
```

### Phase 4: Pull Connected Sources (If Available)

```
If CRM connected:
1. Query closed-won deals with competitor field = [Competitor]
2. Query closed-lost deals with competitor field = [Competitor]
3. Extract win/loss patterns

If docs connected:
1. Search for "battlecard [competitor]"
2. Search for "competitive [competitor]"
3. Pull existing positioning docs

If chat connected:
1. Search for "[Competitor]" mentions (last 90 days)
2. Extract field intel and colleague insights

If transcripts connected:
1. Search calls for "[Competitor]" mentions
2. Extract objections and customer quotes
```

### Phase 5: Build HTML Artifact

```
1. Structure data for each competitor
2. Build comparison matrix
3. Generate individual battlecards
4. Create talk tracks for each scenario
5. Compile landmine questions
6. Render as self-contained HTML
7. Save as [YourCompany]-battlecard-[date].html
```

```

## Refresh Cadence

Competitive intel gets stale. Recommended refresh:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Monthly** | Quick refresh — new releases, news, pricing changes |
| **Before major deal** | Deep refresh for specific competitor in that deal |
| **After win/loss** | Update patterns with new data |
| **Competitor announcement** | Immediate update on that competitor |

---

## Tips for Better Intel

1. **Be honest about weaknesses** — Credibility comes from acknowledging where competitors are strong
2. **Focus on outcomes, not features** — "They have X feature" matters less than "customers achieve Y result"
3. **Update from the field** — Best intel comes from actual customer conversations, not just websites
4. **Plant landmines, don't badmouth** — Ask questions that expose weaknesses; never trash-talk
5. **Track releases religiously** — What they ship tells you their strategy and your opportunity
